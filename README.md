# Fullscreen APP with Windows forms

This program was made as a game/program launcher, it gets and saves the current resolution of the Windows OS (widht and height in pixels), then it changes the resolution (to the selected one), then returns to the original resolution, after closing the game.

To do this job it uses a binary program licensed under BSD.
